# helloworld
This is a readme file for my first repository.

It is created by Morris Fr√∂schl from the class 5AHME.

The aim of this repository is to find out how to work with github.

The data on this repository has already been changed several times to get a routine of how to work with github.

Any other repositories will follow soon.
